# Story Buddy

Story Buddy is an English-language reading tutor for kids.

With story buddy, users can generate a small story using a prompt (text/audio)
or an image. It then listens as the user reads along, advancing when the user reads the correct words. With the power of Gemma 3n, it can even do this offline!
